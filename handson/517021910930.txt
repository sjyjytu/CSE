Question 1: Please briefly answer the role of DNS in your own words.
DNS，域名系统，就是将域名和IP建立相互映射，使得人们可以用域名来访问网页而不是记复杂的IP地址，更方便了。

Question 2: The type field have a few different values to indicate the kind of this record. What do "A", "NS" and "CNAME" mean?
A: 主机地址资源记录，将DNS域名映射到IPv4的32位地址中
NS: Name Server，将owner中指定的DNS域名映射到name_server_domain_name字段中指定的运行DNS服务器的主机名
CNAME：规范名资源记录，将owner字段中的别名或备用的DNS域名映射到canonical_name字段中指定的标准或主要DNS域名。

Question 3: How can we ask a specific dns server (instead of the default) for information about a domain name? When I use "dig www.baidu.com",the DNS server is 192.168.110.2. However if this server crashed and I have to ask the server 8.8.8.8, what command should I use?
用命令dig @8.8.8.8 www.baidu.com

Question 4: Do you know the process of solving domain name "lirone.csail.mit.edu"? You need to go through the steps of resolving a particular hostname, mimicing a standard recursive query. Assuming it knows nothing else about a name, a DNS resolver will ask a well-known root server. The root servers on the Internet are in the domain root-servers.net. You can use "%dig . ns" to get the list of 13 root servers.You can show us the result of each step or briefly introduce your idea.[Hint: you should start from "edu"]
首先我用了dig lirone.csail.mit.edu +trace
